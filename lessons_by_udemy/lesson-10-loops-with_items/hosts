# Ansible is a case sensitive for naming, for example stagind_db and staging_DB are different groups

# [dev_servers:var] - it is group for variables with key-value elements are written with an equal sign

# [staging_ALL:children] - is general (parent) group for combining other groups and we enumerate all groups in this group
