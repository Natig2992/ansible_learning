# alias name for servers
# myserver ansible_host=10.50.1.1 # as example

# All servers are included either "all" group or group_with_specified name or "ungrouped"(withoud group_name)

# Ansible is a case sensitive for naming, for example stagind_db and staging_DB are different groups

# [dev_servers:var] - it is group for variables with key-value elements are written with an equal sign

# [staging_ALL:children] - is general (parent) group for combining other groups and we enumerate all groups in this group

#[ev_servers:vars]
#ansible_user=root 
#ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/root/.ssh/id_rsa



# "ansible-inventory --list | jq" - show all groups,servers and variables in JSON-format, jq command for nice output
# "ansible-inventory --graph" - show the same, as previous command, but in tree-mode and without variables
